 ProjectOverview
 
1. System Objectives 
        Develop a CNN-powered mobile application capable of detecting rice pests and diseases through image recognition using smartphone cameras.
        Provide decision support and management guidelines for detected pests and diseases to assist farmers in implementing timely interventions.
        Integrate real-time APIs (mapping, weather forecasts, and agricultural news) to enhance situational awareness and decision-making.
        Enable expert collaboration and knowledge sharing through a built-in communication and advisory feature.
        Provide an admin role (Municipal Agriculture Office) to oversee pest and disease reports, monitor outbreak areas, and generate reports for policy and intervention planning.


2. Proposed Scope 
    The scope of this project centers on the development of a mobile-only application designed to support rice pest and disease management through role-based access for farmers, agricultural experts, and administrators. The system is intended to provide image-based detection of rice pests and diseases using convolutional neural network (CNN) models, enabling real-time capture, analysis, and delivery of results directly through mobile devices. To enhance decision-making and situational awareness, the application will also integrate external APIs such as weather forecasts, mapping services, and rice-related agricultural news. Furthermore, the system will feature role-based dashboards tailored to the needs of different stakeholders, including detection and advisory tools for farmers, validation and recommendation modules for experts, and monitoring and reporting functionalities for administrators in the Municipal Agriculture Office. In addition, collaboration features will be incorporated to facilitate direct communication between farmers and experts within the application. Despite its potential, the project will operate under specific limitations. The detection capability will be confined solely to rice pests and diseases, excluding other crops and agricultural concerns. The functionality of the application will rely heavily on a stable internet connection for model processing and API integrations, which may limit accessibility in areas with poor connectivity. Moreover, advanced analytics and large-scale data visualizations will be simplified to suit the mobile platform, ensuring usability without compromising system performance. These limitations establish the boundaries of the system while emphasizing its practicality and relevance to rice farming communities.

3. Stakeholders 
    1.Farmers (End-Users) – Capture rice field images, receive detection results and advice.
    2.Agricultural Experts (Collaborators/Validators) – Validate pest and disease cases, provide recommendations.
    3.Municipal Agriculture Office (Administrators) – Manage the system, oversee rice health conditions, monitor outbreak areas, and generate official reports.
    4.Researchers/Developers (Project Team) – Build and maintain the mobile application and AI model.

4. Tools/Technologies
Visual Studio Code, Ionic, Angular, Firebase, Public API (Weather Forecast, Mapping)
